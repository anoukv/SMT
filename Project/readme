Welcome.

SVM.py, counting_scores.py and counting_scores_extended.py are the main code that was used for out expiriments. 
The data is supposed to be in ../../project3_data/

The counting scores run ~15 times faster using the pypy alternative python implementation.

The profiling and NN.py contain code for expiriments that we did not end up using in our report. NN is nearest neighbor, profiling is some pos tag modeling. 

Readers read the sentences and split and mix the data.
Plotter makes the nice plots we had in our report.
