\section{Introduction}
One solution to machine translation is to find translations of words in the sentence. IBM Model 1 is an example of such a word-based model. In this report we present our implementation of IBM Model 1 and its Expectation-Maximization (EM) training. In section \ref{IBM} we will give a little background on IBM Model 1, in section \ref{em} we lay out the EM formulas. In section \ref{own} we propose a simple improvement to IBM Model 1 reducing its assumptions. Finally, we present our results in section \ref{results}.


\section{IBM Model I}
\label{IBM}
IBM model 1 is the first and least complex in the series of IBM translation models. It is based only on word level translation probabilities that are derived from a training corpus. The model only defines translation probabilities as $P(f|e)$ where $f$ is a french word and $e$ is an english word and does not look at word context or sentence structure. The $P(f|e)$ is obtained using the EM algorithm described in \ref{em}. IBM model 1 does not address word re-ordering or sentence structure.

\section{Expectation Maximization Training Formula}
\label{em}
The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to iteratively re-estimate the probability of $P(f|e)$, converging on every iteration. The estimated probabilities $P(f|e)$ are initialized uniformly and are stored in a translation table $T$
