\section{Phrase Extraction and Phrase Translation Probabilites}
Phrase translation probabilities play an important role in phrase-based machine translation systems \cite{koehn}. To be able to compute the joint and (bidirectional) conditional translation probabilities of a phrase pair, we first need to extract all possible phrase pairs from an aligned training corpus. Although many phrase pairs can be extracted from two parallel sentences, there are only a few that are likely to be each other's translation. In order to limit the number of phrase pairs we extract from the data, we only want to extract phrases that are consistent with the word alignments. A phrase pair is consistent with a word alignment if all words in the source phrase align with a word in the target phrase and vice versa.  In addition to allowing only consistent phrase pairs we will further restrict ourselves to extracting only phrases up to length 4. In section \ref{implem1} and \ref{implem3} we give an overview of how we extracted the phrase pairs and computed their joint and (bidirectional) translation probabilities.\\\\
Once we obtain a phrase table, we might wonder how the extracted phrases of one parallel corpus compare to the phrases extracted from another parallel corpus. In order to explore the coverage of the phrase table extracted from the training data we compute the percentage of phrase pairs in a held-out set which are available in the training set phrase table. We could simply look at how may of the phrase pairs are available in the training set phrase table directly or we could concatenate a number of phrase pairs from the training set to retrieve the phrase pairs in the held-out set. In section \ref{implem2} we will discuss both methods, in \ref{eval} we discuss our results.

\section{Related work}
In phrase-based machine translation systems we attempt to find an English sentence so that: 
$$\textit{argmax}_e P(e) \times P(f|e)$$
To compute $P(f|e)$, in a phrase-based machine translation system we use phrases instead of words. Different methods have been proposed to extract phrase pairs from a parallel corpus in order to estimate the phrase translation probabilities. A very common method is to extract phrase pairs from a word alignment \cite{koehn}\cite{theother}. In this method all phrases for both sentences are considered, but only the phrase pairs that are consistent with the word alignment are extracted. A phrase pair $(f\bar, e\bar)$ is consistent with the word alignment $A$ if
\begin{enumerate}
\item at least one pair from the alignment occurs in the phrase pair
\item all words in the foreign phrase aligned to a word in the target phrase or not aligned at all
\item all words in the target phrase are aligned to a word in the source phrase.
\end{enumerate} 
This method of extracting phrases is closest to our implementation. In \cite{super} a method is proposed based on inversion transduction grammars that reduces the alignment and the extraction step into a single step. \\\\
There are different ways of estimating the phrase translation probabilities, the simplest way is to calculate the relative frequency. However, other methods have been proposed such as lexical weighting \cite{lexical} where the phrase translation probabilities are estimated by using the conditional probabilities of the words that make up the phrase.
% also sort of 'possible solutions', right?

\section{Implementation}
In this section we will describe our implementation for the phrase extraction algorithm, as well as the probability estimation algorithm and the algorithm to compute the coverage of the phrase table. 

\subsection{Phrase Extraction}
\label{implem1}
Our algorithm first extracts all possible phrases up to length 4 from both the source as well as the target sentence. For every combination of the extracted phrases it will then check whether or not this phrase pair is consistent with the given word alignment. It does so by collecting all the words with which the source sentence as well as the target sentence are aligned. Let $e$ be the target phrase and $f$ be the source phrase. We check for every word in $e$ to which word in $f$ it is aligned according to the given alignment and call the set of found alignments $e_a$. Note that this set corresponds directly to the words in $f$. We do the same for all words in $f$ giving us the set $f_a$. Because $f_a$ and $e_a$ correspond directly to $e$ and $f$ respectively we can determine whether the phrase pair is consistent with the given word alignment by checking if $f_a$ is a subset of $e$ and $e_a$ is a subset of $f$. If this is the case, we conclude that all words in the foreign phrase are aligned to a word in the target phrase (or not aligned at all) and all words in the target phrase are aligned to a word in the source phrase, covering two of the three requirements for consistency. None of the words from either side is aligned to a word that is not in one of the phrase pairs. The last requirement is most easy to meet, at least one word in $f$ as well as $e$ has to be aligned with another word.
